Function Analysis
Function Name: swapTokens
Block Explorer Link: Example Block Explorer
Function Code:

```solidity

contract TokenSwapContract {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    address public tokenA;
    address public tokenB;

    function swapTokens(uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) external {
        require(amountA > 0 && amountB > 0, "Amounts must be greater than zero");

        // Simulated logic for swapping tokens
        bytes memory data = abi.encode(tokenA, tokenB, amountA, amountB);

        // Assuming some address of a liquidity pool or another contract
        address targetContract = 0x123...;

        // Using low-level call to interact with target contract
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = targetContract.call(data);
        require(success, "Swap execution failed");

        // Further logic after swap
    }
}

```

Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method: abi.encode

## Explanation
1. Purpose: The swapTokens function facilitates the exchange of tokens between two parties within the Example DeFi Protocol.

2. Detailed Usage:

3. Encoding: The abi.encode function is used to pack tokenA, tokenB, amountA, and amountB into a byte array data. This encoded data is then passed as a parameter in a low-level call to another contract (targetContract), which could be a decentralized exchange or liquidity pool contract.

4. Low-level Call: The call function allows the TokenSwapContract to invoke a function on targetContract using the encoded data. This approach is flexible and allows the protocol to interact with various external contracts dynamically.

## Impact:
- Functionality: Enables seamless token swaps between users or liquidity providers.
- Flexibility: The use of abi.encode and call provides flexibility in interacting with external contracts. It allows the protocol to execute complex transactions such as swaps based on user inputs.
- Integration: Integrates with existing DeFi infrastructure by leveraging call to interact with decentralized exchanges or liquidity pools, contributing to the protocol's liquidity and trading functionality.
